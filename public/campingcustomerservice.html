          <p class="">It doesn't have to be super expensive to have an app which is available for your customers on iOS for Apple users and on Android for those that prefer Android devices.</p>
          <p>
            The Camping Customer Service app has been made so you can customise it and use it as soon as you get it. After you have got the subscription and the app is deployed to the app stores you go to the settings page with your admin access and configure it to suit your campsite.
          </p>  Fill in the details of your business and upload some images and you will be on the way to a useful app for your customers and your business. </p>

            <p>A better connection to customers means happy customers who will keep coming back. In the ap there is a way for them to contact you and ask questions or inform you of things happening in the campsite that you should know about. </p>
            <p>Such as an item missing from the bungalow / mobile home. A plot neighbour who is behaving badly and disturbing other guests. A question about the campsite they need an answer to before they confirm the booking. Of course there are links in the app to your website so bookings can be made directly.</p>

            <p class="card-title mx-auto text-2xl">Information about the Campsite</p>
            I expect you will have Information about the campsite on the web page, but that is static information. Things change each month, week or even daily. Use the app to inform your customers about an event you managed to set up at the last minute. A new entertainment schedule due to a staff change. </p>
            <p>
                Offers the supermarket was to pass on to the customers, or new menu options in the bar, restaurant. Perhaps you only just got the details of an event taking place outside of the campsite which you think will draw in extra customers. Put it in the app in the Features section.

            <p>The app already has some information about nearby local towns and tourist entertainment. The app has been set up so you can add more which suit your locality. Add a beach to the nearby beaches page. Add a suggested day out campers might like to take while staying at your campsite.</p>

            <p>Photos of the plot and detailed information about the plot</p>
            <p>You can add as much or as little information as you think you need. Wher you add the plots to the app you can leave out the ones which are not available because they are occupied for the whole season. Or maybe the plots are set aside for a group that use the space every year.</p>
            <p>If things change with the plot it is very easy to go back into the app and make changes at any time. No need to make contact with the developer of the app like you have to do with the web page developers for your web site.</p>
