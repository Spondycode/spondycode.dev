  <p class="">It doesn't have to be expensive to get your business served by an applications for the two operating systems Android and for iOS. Spondycode is keen to provide quality apps at a reasonable price. </p>
    <h1 class=" text-xl font-semibold mt-12">Camping Customer Service</h1>
    <p>
      When you are running a camping site it can be fluid during the busiest times. Maybe the Zumba instructor has to change the day for the class this week. Instead of having to scramble to get new flyers all around the campsite at short notice, use the app to tell your customers of the change. With this fully customisable app you can jump in and change the details whenever you want. No need to try and contact the web master to make alterations on the website and wait for who knows how long to get the changes.
    </p>
    <h2 class=" text-xl font-semibold mt-8">Make the changes yourself as an admin in your own app.</h2>
    
    <p class=" mb-36 " >No need to wait for the webmaster to find time to update your website. Just do it yourself in an app you will find easy to use and your customers will enjoy the up to date information about your camp site. There's also a message service built into the app so customers can ask questions. Keep customers happy with your campsite and they will surely return year after year.</p>
